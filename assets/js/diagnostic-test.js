Yet in the last three or four years a small but visible group of people вЂ” most of them under thirty вЂ” have started writing letters again.\n\nWhat surprised researchers was not the trend itself but who was driving it. The new letter-writers were not nostalgic older people; they were the same generation that grew up with smartphones. In interviews they often describe the same shift: a tiredness with the speed of digital messages, a wish for something slower, and a desire to send something that the receiver cannot delete with one tap.\n\nThere is also a quieter cultural reason. Several writers, including some Russian and British essayists, have argued that a hand-written letter forces a kind of attention that has become rare. You cannot easily multitask while writing one. You cannot change it after sending. The slowness is the point.\n\nThis does not mean that letters will replace messengers, of course. They will not. But the recent revival shows something interesting about digital fatigue: when a technology saturates everyday life, even small analogue alternatives start to feel meaningful again. Letter writing has become, for some people, a small ritual of paying attention вЂ” to one person, for one moment.",

All three are available on a rooftop near the Garden Ring.\nHost: What was the hardest part of the first year?\nOlga: Two things. The first was technical — I had read several books, but books cannot show you how a swarm sounds at six in the morning. The second was social. Some neighbours were nervous about the bees. I learned to talk to them carefully, to invite them up, to show that the hive was calm. After two seasons, no one complained.\nHost: And what surprised you most?\nOlga: That the bees changed me more than I changed the rooftop. I used to think faster was always better.

Forecasts in education journals between 2005 and 2015 confidently suggested that by 2025 the average student would carry only a tablet. The reality has been very different. A growing body of research, particularly in Northern Europe and parts of Asia, shows that university students are now actively choosing paper books for serious reading вЂ” even when digital versions are cheaper, lighter and immediately available.\n\nThe reasons are not nostalgic. In repeated studies, students who read complex academic texts on paper outperform their peers reading the same texts on screens, especially on tasks that require sustained inference rather than quick fact retrieval. The difference is small for short pieces, but consistent for anything longer than about a thousand words.\n\nResearchers offer several explanations. Paper does not interrupt the reader; it does not buzz, glow, or invite a parallel browser window. It encourages physical landmarks вЂ” a particular paragraph is remembered as being near the top of a specific page вЂ” that screens cannot easily replicate. And it discourages the temptation, common among digital natives, to scroll quickly and assume understanding.\n\nThis does not amount to a rejection of digital tools. The same students typically use laptops for searches, note-taking and quick reference. What they are doing, instead, is matching the medium to the task: digital for fast and connected work, paper for slow and analytical reading. The interesting question is whether libraries, publishers and even universities themselves will respond by treating this choice as serious вЂ” or continue to assume that the digital future is the only future worth planning for.",

The story is more nuanced than the headlines suggest.\n\nSince 2014, Paris has built over 1,000 kilometres of cycle lanes, reduced car access in the city centre and expanded public squares. Critics often note that progress has been slower and messier than in Amsterdam. They are right, but they often miss the most important difference: Paris started from a much higher car density and a much wider street layout, both designed for traffic.\n\nWhat surprised urban planners was not the resistance — every transformation produces resistance — but the speed at which behaviour shifted once infrastructure was provided. Within two years of opening protected lanes, cycling among women and older residents tripled. These are the groups that usually avoid cycling in unsafe conditions, so their participation is a strong indicator of real safety.\n\nHowever, Paris has also revealed the limits of the Amsterdam model. Long suburban commutes still depend on cars. Many delivery vehicles cannot easily be replaced. The mayor's office has had to invest heavily in cargo bikes, electric vans and shared bike systems just to support what was previously taken for granted.\n\nThe lesson is not that Paris is failing or succeeding.

A radiologist who has reviewed ten thousand chest X-rays develops an exceptional eye for chest pathology вЂ” and a measurable blind spot for anomalies in other parts of the same image. A senior litigator who has won hundreds of cases on procedural grounds will, even unconsciously, frame new disputes in procedural terms. The expertise produces depth at the cost of width.\n\nThis is not a personal failing. It is a structural feature of how human attention works at high levels of specialisation. The brain, presented with familiar patterns, recognises them faster than it questions them. That speed is precisely what makes an expert useful in their domain. But the same speed becomes a liability the moment the problem in front of them is not exactly the one their experience predicts.\n\nThe practical lesson is not that expertise is unreliable. It clearly is reliable, within its proper domain. The lesson is about how expert advice should be requested and how it should be received. A wise client does not ask a single specialist to interpret a complicated situation; they ask two or three, ideally from neighbouring fields. A wise expert, in turn, names the limits of their own perspective without apology, treating those limits as professional information rather than weakness.\n\nThe deeper, less comfortable implication concerns the institutions that train experts. Most professional education rewards the deepening of a chosen field, not the cultivation of awareness about its blind spots. Doctors are not formally trained in the psychology of medical error. Lawyers are not formally trained in the limits of their own argumentation styles. Where such training does exist, it is usually optional, marginal and easy to ignore. As a result, the paradox of expertise reproduces itself, generation after generation, in fields that genuinely need it discussed.",

                  "script": "In today's lecture I want to focus on what I will call the diagnostic temptation in social commentary. The case I will use is the recent discussion of loneliness as an epidemic.\n\nThe vocabulary of epidemic is unusually powerful. It moves a problem from the realm of personal misfortune into the realm of public health, which means budgets, agencies and policy. That is often useful. The 2023 Surgeon General advisory in the United States, for instance, would have attracted very little attention if it had used softer language. By choosing the word epidemic, it secured a level of seriousness that purely sociological framings rarely achieve.\n\nHowever, the same vocabulary can mislead. An epidemic implies a pathogen, a vector and individual cases. Loneliness, when examined carefully, behaves more like an ecological condition than a contagion. It emerges from the way cities are built, from how working hours have shifted, from which institutions have been allowed to weaken. It is not transmitted; it is produced.\n\nThis distinction matters because the two framings recommend very different interventions. A pathological framing favours individualised responses: therapy, medication, perhaps an app. An ecological framing favours structural responses: walkable neighbourhoods, public libraries, time-protective labour laws. Both can coexist, but they are not equivalent.\n\nThe deeper question — and this is where I want you to push beyond conventional readings — is who benefits from each framing. Clinical and technological interventions are easier to monetise and easier to study. Structural interventions are slower, less visible and politically uncomfortable, because they imply that current city design, current labour culture, and current public spending priorities have been quietly producing the very condition they now claim to treat.\n\nI am not suggesting that individual treatment is useless. I am suggesting that, taken in isolation, it acts as a kind of moral comfort. It allows societies to be seen to be doing something about loneliness without changing the structures that produce it. That, I would argue, is precisely the conservatism of a diagnostic vocabulary applied to a structural problem.",

                  "text": "Few ideas in science enjoy as much rhetorical favour as simplicity. Researchers invoke Occam's razor; teachers cite Newton's elegant equations; popular writers admire those theories that can be condensed into a single sentence. There is, however, a quieter scientific tradition that holds simplicity to be a useful working preference rather than a reliable indicator of truth. According to this view, the universe has no obligation to be elegant, and the conviction that it must be can become its own intellectual hazard.\n\nThe argument is not that simplicity is unimportant. A theory with fewer arbitrary parameters is easier to test, easier to teach and harder to disguise as something it is not. These are genuine virtues. The problem appears when simplicity becomes a heuristic so deeply assumed that it operates as a hidden axiom вЂ” when researchers reach instinctively for the simpler model because they believe nature must agree, rather than because the evidence has yet decided between competing alternatives.\n\nHistorical examples are instructive. Early models of planetary motion before Kepler were aesthetically attractive but explanatorily poor. Pre-genetic models of inheritance were similarly tidy. In both cases, the simpler description was, for a while, mistaken for the more correct description. Acceptance of the messier alternative required the field to tolerate temporary inelegance вЂ” to live, intellectually, in a less polished house until the new theory could be properly furnished.\n\nThis lesson has methodological consequences. A research culture that punishes complexity as inelegant will systematically slow the discovery of phenomena whose actual structure happens to be complex. Biology is the obvious example. So is climate science, where the genuine answer involves dozens of variables behaving non-linearly, and where each attempt to reduce the picture to a clean slogan misrepresents the science it intends to summarise. Strangely, the strongest demand for simplification often comes from outside the discipline rather than from within it.\n\nThe wisest formulation, perhaps, is to treat simplicity as a default rather than a doctrine. Begin with simple models, prefer them when they fit, and abandon them without sentiment when the evidence does not cooperate. Refuse, however, to mistake parsimony for proof. A theory survives because the world appears to behave the way it predicts, not because it pleases our taste for tidiness. To remember this вЂ” and to insist on it inside disciplines that are quietly drifting away from it вЂ” is one of the small, ungrateful jobs that careful thinkers continue to do, often without applause.",

You wrote that memory and history are opposed, and that the historian's task is to correct memory with evidence. I think this framing, while attractive, conceals more than it reveals.\n\nConsider the following: in many historical contexts, communal memory has preserved patterns that documentary evidence missed entirely. Stories of pre-industrial epidemics, of unrecorded labour movements, of localised famines — these survived for generations in oral testimony before written sources caught up. Sometimes the documents were never produced, and sometimes they were produced selectively by people with their own interests. Memory, in those cases, was not the failed shadow of history; it was the only available record.\n\nThis does not mean that memory is reliable in the way documents can be. It is selective, suggestible and reshaped by present-day concerns. But the documentary record is also selective. The question, in any concrete case, is not which source is purer but which gives us the more honest reconstruction when combined with the other.\n\nThe danger of a strong opposition between memory and history is that it can seem to authorise the dismissal of communal recollection whenever it conflicts with paperwork. In practice, this dismissal has often served the powerful, because paperwork is more likely to survive when produced by the powerful. A history that systematically privileges documents will systematically under-record what was important to people who could not write, were not allowed to write, or wrote in forms we have not preserved.\n\nSo I would suggest a more dialectical formulation. History is what survives critical examination; memory is what a community lives by. The serious historian does not choose between them. The serious historian uses each to interrogate the other — and accepts, sometimes uncomfortably, that the most accurate account is produced not by adjudicating between them but by reading them together.",
